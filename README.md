- 👋 Hi, I’m @duccchess
- 👀 I’m interested in football and anime
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code :D
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything really, I just need the experience.
- ⚡ Fun fact: if I was half as good at IoT as I was at calculating the amount of sleep I'll get if I watch the next episode I'd probably know what Raspberry Pi is
